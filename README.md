# Libft
Build a C library emulating standard functions, enhancing C proficiency, coding standards, memory managementâ€”a cornerstone project at 42, fostering essential skills.

The "Libft" project is the first project assigned to students at the 42 school, which is known for its project-based and peer-driven learning approach.

Summary:

The "Libft" project involves creating a custom C library from scratch. This library will contain a collection of general-purpose functions that are typically found in the standard C library (Libc). The goal is to reimplement these functions, giving them names with the "ft_" prefix (e.g., ft_strlen instead of strlen). These functions should behave exactly like their standard C library counterparts and comply with their respective man page definitions.

Why is it Useful:

    Learning the Basics: This project serves as a foundation for students to grasp fundamental concepts in C programming. It involves understanding how standard library functions work and implementing them from scratch. It's a great way to build a solid understanding of C programming.

    Developing Custom Tools: By creating a custom library with commonly used functions, students have a valuable toolkit they can use in their future projects. This library becomes a resource to simplify and streamline code development in subsequent assignments.

    Norm Compliance: The project emphasizes following coding standards, or the "Norm," which is crucial in the 42 school's pedagogy. Students learn the importance of adhering to coding conventions, which promotes code consistency and readability.

    Memory Management: The project enforces proper memory allocation and deallocation practices. Students must ensure that memory allocated dynamically is freed when it's no longer needed, teaching them good memory management habits.

    Makefiles and Compilation: Students gain experience with Makefiles, a build automation tool, which is essential in managing code compilation. They learn how to compile their source code with specified flags and dependencies.

    Bonus Functions: The project includes a bonus part that challenges students to go beyond the basics by implementing additional functions. This encourages them to deepen their understanding of C programming.

    Peer Evaluation: The project promotes peer evaluation, as students are encouraged to create test programs and review each other's work. This peer-driven approach helps students learn from one another and defend their projects during evaluations.

Overall, the "Libft" project is an essential first step in a student's journey at 42, providing them with a strong foundation in C programming and coding standards. It equips them with valuable tools and practices that will be applied in their future assignments and projects.
